# mc-catalog

Set of scripts to analyze and plot the results of the **ASteCA** processing of
the 210 MC clusters in our database, observed with Washington photometry.


## Scripts and data files description

### `../`

* `bb_cat.dat`

  RA & DEC positions for the 3740 clusters in the
  [Bica et al. (2008)](http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2008MNRAS.389..678B)
  catalog ([Table 3](http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/
  MNRAS/389/678/table3)).

* `mc_cat_analysis.py`

 Script that Produces the main figures by comparing parameters with each other
 (KDE maps), with literature values (1:1 plots) and distributed in space
 (RA vs DEC plots.)

 Functions are stored in the `functions/` folder.

### `extinction_MCEV/`

* `IRSA_MC_ext.tbl`

  Output of the [IRSA](http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DUST/) query to
  obtain the [Schlafly & Finkbeiner
  (2011)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...737..103S) corrected `E(B-V)`
  values for the 210 clusters.

* `IRSA_BB_ext.tbl`

  Idem above for the 3740 clusters in the Bica et al. catalog.

* `ra_dec_exts_mult_matches.dat`

  Output of the [MCEV](http://dc.zah.uni-heidelberg.de/mcextinct/q/cone/form)
  service query. Each of the 210 cluster's position is matched with at least
  one area in the reddening maps containing a E(V-I) value.

  The cluster [OHSC28]
  (http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=OHSC+28)
  needed a 6.0 deg search radius to find areas with extinction in the maps,
  making it the one furthest away from the areas studied in the MCEV maps.

* `extin_analysis.py`

 Gets the extinction data from the table obtained via the MCEV service
 (`ra_dec_exts_mult_matches.dat`) and produces for each of the 210 clusters a
 value of the closest, average and maximum extinction values.

 The results are stored in the `cls_exts_match.dat` file.

* `cls_exts_match.dat`

  Output of the above script.

### `ages_mass_lit/`

* `pietrz_00_LMC.dat`

  Ages for 600 LMC clusters obtained in [Pietrzynski & Udalski (2000)](http://
  adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000AcA....50..337P).

* `hunter_03.dat`

   Clusters in the S/LMC from [Hunter et al. (2003)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/
   abs/2003AJ....126.1836H), 748 belong to the LMC and 191 to the SMC for a
   total of 939 clusters.

* `chiosi_06.dat`

  Contains 311 SMC clusters younger than 1 Gyr (ages determined using isochrone
  fitting) from the work by [Chiosi et al. (2006)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/
  abs/2006A%26A...452..179C). Also lists several other structures/objects, ie:
  association, supernovas, H II regions and entities in between.

* `BB_10.dat`

  List of ages for 151 SMC and 539 LMC clusters in the database presented in
  [Bonato & Bica (2010)](http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2010MNRAS.403..996B).
  Only 285 out of the 690 clusters have an age value assigned.

* `glatt_10.dat`

  CMD ages taken from the [Glatt et al. (2010)](http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/
  0004-6361/201014187) catalog for 1194 LMC clusters and 322 SMC clusters.

* `popescu_12_LMC.dat`

  List of ages and masses for 632 clusters in the database presented in
  [Popescu et al. (2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...751..122P)
  with ages correlated to the *Hunter et al* catalog.

* `popescu_12_LMC_glatt.dat`

  Idem above, but also adds ages taken from the *Glatt et al.* catalog, for
  288 clusters in the *Hunter et al.* catalog.

* `cross_match.py`

  Matches the data in the above databases to those clusters processed by
  ASteCA.
