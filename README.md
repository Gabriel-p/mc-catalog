* `glatt_10.dat`

  CMD ages taken from the [Glatt et al. (2010)](http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/
  0004-6361/201014187) catalog for 1194 LMC clusters and 322 SMC clusters.

  List of ages and masses for 632 clusters in the database presented in
  [Popescu et al. (2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...751..122P)
  with ages correlated to the *Hunter et al* catalog.

* `popescu_12_LMC_glatt.dat`

  Idem above, but also adds ages taken from the *Glatt et al.* catalog, for
  288 clusters in the *Hunter et al.* catalog.

* `cross_match.py`

  Matches the data in the above databases to those clusters processed by
  ASteCA.

* `matched_clusters.dat`

  Final data file with all matched clusters between **ASteCA** and the
  databases in the literature.

### `aux_funcs/`

* `move_files_sizes.py`

  Script to move files into `input_XX/` folders distributed so that each
  folder has approximately the same total size.

* `add_p_vals/`

  Contains the script and input / output files used to add KDE p_values
  to the `asteca_output.dat` file from the 1st run, since the function was
  turned off.


### `extinction_MCEV/`

* `IRSA_MC_ext.tbl`

  Output of the [IRSA](http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DUST/) query to
  obtain the [Schlafly & Finkbeiner
  (2011)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...737..103S) corrected `E(B-V)`
  values for the 210 clusters.

* `IRSA_BB_ext.tbl`

  Idem above for the 3740 clusters in the Bica et al. catalog.

* `ra_dec_exts_mult_matches.dat`

  Output of the [MCEV](http://dc.zah.uni-heidelberg.de/mcextinct/q/cone/form)
  service query. Each of the 210 cluster's position is matched with at least
  one area in the reddening maps containing a E(V-I) value.

  The cluster [OHSC28]
  (http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=OHSC+28)
  needed a 6.0 deg search radius to find areas with extinction in the maps,
  making it the one furthest away from the areas studied in the MCEV maps.

* `extin_analysis.py`

 Gets the extinction data from the table obtained via the MCEV service
 (`ra_dec_exts_mult_matches.dat`) and produces for each of the 210 clusters a
 value of the closest, average and maximum extinction values.

 The results are stored in the `cls_exts_match.dat` file.

* `cls_exts_match.dat`

  Output of the above script.

### `figures/`

   Output figures from main script.

### `functions/`

   Functions called by the main script.

### `runs/`

 Folder that contains the results for all the runs.

#### `1st_run/`

First batch of data obtained using the following parameters:

  - Semi mode.
  - Center found with 100px search area.
  - Auto radius.
  - Field regions: 10.
  - Decontamination algorithm: auto.
  - Reduced membership: Bayesian blocks binning
  - Restricted range in extinction: MCEV max + 0.1.
  - Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.8, 19.201, 0.05] ;
    LMC, [18.3, 18.701, 0.05].
  - Best fit: Dolphin + Knuth binning.

#### `2nd_run/`

Second batch of data for 83 clusters (60 LMC, 23 SMC) from the 1st run,
marked to be re-processed. The data was obtained using the same extinction and
distance modulus range, and changing the following parameters:

  * Center, radius, number of field regions, max E(B-V) and binning of red_memb
   and best_fit, as described in `README.dat`.

The following clusters were left un-processed (no reason, just didn't bother):

  * NGC1917, SL579, SL588, LW54, NGC419, SL244

#### `3rd_run/`

  Third batch of data obtained using the following parameters:

  * Semi mode with center and radius fixed for several clusters.
  * Number of field regions set individually for some clusters.
  * Restricted range in extinction: **MCEV max for all clusters**.
  * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
    LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02].

#### `4th_run/`

  Fourth batch, same parameters as in 3rd run but increased number of
  generations and mutation rate. Some   clusters had their parameters adjusted
  in `semi_input.dat`.

  * gens=3000
  * mut_rate=0.2

#### `5th_run/`

  Increased mutation rate, three blocks of clusters processed
  with the following options:

  * mut_rate=0.25 (all blocks)
  * skip DA + red_memb: local + scott
  * skip DA + red_memb: local + blocks
  * skip DA + skip red_memb <-- Will fit mostly field stars if n_memb is low.

#### `6th_run/`

  Sixth run, 16 problematic clusters processed in three blocks with:

  * DA + red_memb=scott
  * skip DA + red_memb=scott
  * DA + red_memb=blocks (same as 3rd run)

#### `7th_run/`

  Seventh run, 20 high mass clusters re-process with higher mass max limit.
  Parameters used:

  * max mass = 30000
  * generations = 3000
  * mut = 0.25

#### `8th_run/`

  Re-process 8 clusters from 1st and 2nd run with extinction and distance
  modulus limits as in 3rd run, more generations and an increased mutation
  rate.

  * Restricted range in extinction: MCEV max for all clusters.
  * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
    LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02]
  * generations = 3000
  * mut = 0.25

#### `9th_run/`

  Three clusters re-processed from the 8th run that showed large age
  differences, with the following parameters changed:

  * generations = 5000
  * n_el = 10
  * n_ei = 100
  * n_es = 25
