  First batch of data obtained using the following parameters:

  - Semi mode.
  - Center found with 100px search area.
  - Auto radius.
  - Field regions: 10.
  - Decontamination algorithm: auto.
  - Reduced membership: Bayesian blocks binning
  - Restricted range in extinction: MCEV max + 0.1.

  - Best fit: Dolphin + Knuth binning.

#### `2nd_run/`

  Second batch of data for 83 clusters (60 LMC, 23 SMC) from the 1st run,
  marked to be re-processed. The data was obtained using the same extinction
  and distance modulus range, and changing the following parameters:

  * Center, radius, number of field regions, max E(B-V) and binning of red_memb
   and best_fit, as described in `README.dat`.

  The following clusters were left un-processed (no reason, just didn't bother):

  * NGC1917, SL579, SL588, LW54, NGC419, SL244

  clusters:

  * Semi mode with center and radius fixed for several clusters.
  * Number of field regions set individually for some clusters.
  * Restricted range in extinction: **MCEV max for all clusters**.
  * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
    LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02].

#### `4th_run/`

  Fourth run, 44 clusters from 3rd run re-processed. Same parameters as in
  3rd run but increased number of generations and mutation rate, and skipped
  the removal of stars post-DA.
  Some clusters had their parameters adjusted in `semi_input.dat`.

  * skip red_memb
  * gens=3000
  * mut_rate=0.2

#### `5th_run/`

  25 clusters from 4th run re-process. Increased mutation rate, three blocks
  of clusters processed with the following options:

  * mut_rate=0.25 (all blocks)
  * skip DA + red_memb: local + scott
  * skip DA + red_memb: local + blocks
  * skip DA + skip red_memb <-- Will fit mostly field stars if n_memb is low.

  For NGC339 (input_05) the max mass limit was set to 30000.

#### `6th_run/`

  Sixth run, 16 problematic clusters processed in three blocks with:

  * DA + red_memb=scott
  * skip DA + red_memb=scott
  * DA + red_memb=blocks (same as 3rd run)

#### `7th_run/`

  Seventh run, 20 high mass clusters re-processed with higher mass max limit.
  Parameters used:

  * max mass = 30000
  * n_gen = 3000
  * mut = 0.25

#### `8th_run/`

  Re-process 8 clusters from 1st and 2nd run with extinction and distance
  modulus limits as in 3rd run, more generations and an increased mutation
  rate.

  * Restricted range in extinction: MCEV max for all clusters.
  * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
    LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02]
  * n_gen = 3000
  * mut = 0.25

#### `9th_run/`

  Three clusters re-processed from the 8th run that showed large age
  differences, with the following parameters changed:

  * n_gen = 5000
  * n_el = 10
  * n_ei = 100
  * n_es = 25

#### `10th_run/`

  Re-process 13 cluster. Two are the ones were parameter values are still
  taken from the 2nd run, and the remaining 11 are those with
  `\delta log(age)>= 0.5`.

  Use the following parameters:

  * DA + red_memb = scott
  * n_gen = 5000
  * n_el = 1
  * n_ei = 25
  * n_es = 150

#### `11th_run/`

 Re-process the 2 clusters still dragged from the 2nd run (SL218 & BSDL654)
 plus 4 more clusters with large age differences (H88-131, BSDL631, L35, SL579).

 Use the following parameters:

 * DA + red_memb = different values per cluster
 * n_gen = 3000
 * p_mut = 0.1
 * n_el = 1
 * n_ei = 50
 * n_es = 30

#### `12th_run/`

 Re-process SL218 using the following parameters:

 * field regions = 25
 * DA + red_memb = auto + local (blocks)
 * n_pop = 500
 * n_gen = 2000
 * p_mut = 0.5
 * n_el = 1
 * n_ei = 25
 * n_es = 70

#### `13th_run`

 Re-process all clusters using a binary fraction of 0.

 Eight clusters from the SMC are missing (got lost somewhere in the FTP moving).
 These clusters will not be present in the runs: 14, 15, 16.

#### `14th_run`

  Re-process all clusters using fixed distance moduli (18.49/18.96, S/LMC) and
  increasing the maximum extinction by 0.05. Maximum mass increased to 30000.
  * No bootstrap process is applied.

#### `15th_run`

  Re-process all clusters using:

  * No bootstrap.
  * Range in extinction: **MCEV max + 0.1** for all clusters.
  * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
    LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02]
  * Maximum mass: 30000.

#### `16th_run`

  Equal to 15th run but using a fixed mass of 1500 Mo and `Tolstoy` likelihood
  instead of `Dolphin`.
  **Correction**: I used  *without noticing* a mass interval of:
  `TM 10 1500` in the `params_input.dat` file instead of fixing it to a value
  of `1500`.
  This caused the mass values in the range to be defined by
  `np.arange(10, 1500)` as `[  10,   11,   12, ..., 1497, 1498, 1499]`, ie:
  a step of 1 solar mass.

#### `17th_run`

 Process 8 clusters with large age differences: BSDL631, H88-131, H88-316,
 KMHK975, KMHK979, SL218, SL579, L35.

 * Range in extinction: **MCEV max** for all clusters.
 * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
   LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02]
 * Fixed mass: 1500.
 * `Tolstoy`.

#### `18th_run`

 *Important*: for all these clusters' data files the x,y columns are inverted.

 Process the 29 SMC clusters from Maia et al. (2014). Use the same parameters
 as in the 3rd run:

 * Semi mode with center and radius fixed for several clusters.
 * Number of field regions set individually for some clusters.
 * Restricted range in extinction: **MCEV max for all clusters**.
 * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
   LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02].
 * Total mass: 10000

##### 10th run (8)
Re-run 8 clusters that needed an offset applied to their photometry (which I
found out after processing them in the runs above): B48, H86-76, H86-90,
H86-97, L39, NGC241, NGC242, SOGLE196.

#### `19th_run`

Re-process these clusters to try to improve their fits. H88-131 could be better
fitted for the age and the other two for the metallicity.

1. DA: skip + local + blocks; GA: p_mut=0.35
* H88-131
1. DA: defaults; GA: p_mut=0.35
* NGC294, HW85

#### `20th_run`

Re-process L45 and L50 with better radii estimates. Originally, the values used
where:
rad_L45 = 162.5 (semi); rad_L50 = 170. (auto)

new values are:
rad_L45 = 100. (auto); rad_L50 = 100 (semi)

Since no substantial change is made, these new values are incorporated into the
3rd and 4th run where L50 and L45 where processed, respectively.
KDE probs are borrowed from the previous run, since they were not obtained
here.

Re-process NGC294 and HW85 fixing all parameters except metallicity, with
binary fractions of [0., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.]
Metallicity of NGC294 changed 0.001 --> 0.0005, due to issue #248.
These runs are only used to check the metal-binarity dependence, and are not
added to the final output file.

#### `21st_run`

Re-process 5 OCs whose masses differ greatly from the H03 and P12 estimates.
We use:

* no DA + no local removal of field stars
* no bootstrap
* max mass limit of 500000 with a step of 5000 (Mo)

All other parameter ranges are kept from 3rd run.

#### `22nd_run`

Re-process NGC 419 with a larger radius: 310px in 21st run vs 460px here. The
largest mass value found (with no field star cleaning applied) is 9e04.

#### `23rd_run`

Process 768 synthetic MASSCLEAN clusters to validate ASteCA's mass estimation.
