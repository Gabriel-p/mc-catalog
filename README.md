  Contains the script and input / output files used to add KDE p_values
  to the `asteca_output.dat` file from the 1st run, since the function was
  turned off.

* `move_files_names.py`

* `move_files_sizes.py`

 Script to move files into `input_XX/` folders distributed so that each
 folder has approximately the same total size.

* `ra_dec_exts_mult_matches.dat`

 Output of the MCEV service query with TOPCAT. Each of the cluster's position is
 matched with at least one area in the reddening maps containing a E(V-I) value.

 The cluster [OHSC28](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=OHSC+28)
 needed a 6.0 deg search radius to find areas with extinction in the maps,
 making it the one furthest away from the areas studied in the MCEV maps.

* `extin_analysis.py`

  Gets the extinction data from the table obtained via the MCEV service
  (`ra_dec_exts_mult_matches.dat`) and produces for each of the clusters a
  value of the closest, average and maximum E(B-V) extinction values.
  The transformation equation used is:

  `E(V-I) = 1.38 * E(B-V)`

  according to Tammann et al. 2003, A&A, 404, 423.

  The results are stored in the `cls_exts_match.dat` file.

* `cls_exts_match.dat`

   Output of the above script.


### `figures/`

   Output figures from main script.


### `functions/`

   `*.py`: functions called by the main script.

   `0.004.dat` & `0.008.dat`: Marigo isochrones used by the
   `CMD_obs_vs_asteca.py` script to plot the G10 fitted isochrones.


### `runs/`

 Folder that contains the results for all the runs.

 `large_diff_age_clusts.ods`: analysis of the obtained values in different runs
 for those clusters that display a large age difference with the literature
 values.

  First batch of data obtained using the following parameters:

  - Semi mode.
  - Center found with 100px search area.
  - Auto radius.
  - Field regions: 10.
  - Decontamination algorithm: auto.
  - Reduced membership: Bayesian blocks binning
  - Restricted range in extinction: MCEV max + 0.1.
  - Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.8, 19.201, 0.05] ;

  - Best fit: Dolphin + Knuth binning.

#### `2nd_run/`

  Second batch of data for 83 clusters (60 LMC, 23 SMC) from the 1st run,
  marked to be re-processed. The data was obtained using the same extinction
  and distance modulus range, and changing the following parameters:

  * Center, radius, number of field regions, max E(B-V) and binning of red_memb
   and best_fit, as described in `README.dat`.

  The following clusters were left un-processed (no reason, just didn't bother):

  * NGC1917, SL579, SL588, LW54, NGC419, SL244

#### `3rd_run/`

  Third batch of data obtained using the following parameters, for all
  clusters:

  * Semi mode with center and radius fixed for several clusters.
  * Number of field regions set individually for some clusters.
  * Restricted range in extinction: **MCEV max for all clusters**.
  * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
    LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02].

#### `4th_run/`

  Fourth run, 44 clusters from 3rd run re-processed. Same parameters as in
  3rd run but increased number of generations and mutation rate, and skipped
  the removal of stars post-DA.
  Some clusters had their parameters adjusted in `semi_input.dat`.

  * skip red_memb
  * gens=3000
  * mut_rate=0.2

#### `5th_run/`

  25 clusters from 4th run re-process. Increased mutation rate, three blocks
  of clusters processed with the following options:

  * mut_rate=0.25 (all blocks)
  * skip DA + red_memb: local + scott
  * skip DA + red_memb: local + blocks
  * skip DA + skip red_memb <-- Will fit mostly field stars if n_memb is low.

  For NGC339 (input_05) the max mass limit was set to 30000.

#### `6th_run/`

  Sixth run, 16 problematic clusters processed in three blocks with:

  * DA + red_memb=scott
  * skip DA + red_memb=scott
  * DA + red_memb=blocks (same as 3rd run)

#### `7th_run/`

  Seventh run, 20 high mass clusters re-process with higher mass max limit.
  Parameters used:

  * max mass = 30000
  * n_gen = 3000
  * mut = 0.25

#### `8th_run/`

  Re-process 8 clusters from 1st and 2nd run with extinction and distance
  modulus limits as in 3rd run, more generations and an increased mutation
  rate.

  * Restricted range in extinction: MCEV max for all clusters.
  * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
    LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02]
  * n_gen = 3000
  * mut = 0.25

#### `9th_run/`

  Three clusters re-processed from the 8th run that showed large age
  differences, with the following parameters changed:

  * n_gen = 5000
  * n_el = 10
  * n_ei = 100
  * n_es = 25

#### `10th_run/`

  Re-process 13 cluster. Two are the ones were parameter values are still
  taken from the 2nd run, and the remaining 11 are those with
  `\delta log(age)>= 0.5`.

  Use the following parameters:

  * DA + red_memb = scott
  * n_gen = 5000
  * n_el = 1
  * n_ei = 25
  * n_es = 150

#### `11th_run/`

 Re-process the 2 clusters still dragged from the 2nd run (SL218 & BSDL654)
 plus 4 more clusters with large age differences (H88-131, BSDL631, L35, SL579).

 Use the following parameters:

 * DA + red_memb = different values per cluster
 * n_gen = 3000
 * p_mut = 0.1
 * n_el = 1
 * n_ei = 50
 * n_es = 30

#### `12th_run/`

 Re-process SL218 using the following parameters:

 * field regions = 25
 * DA + red_memb = auto + local (blocks)
 * n_pop = 500
 * n_gen = 2000
 * p_mut = 0.5
 * n_el = 1
 * n_ei = 25
 * n_es = 70

#### `13th_run`

 Re-process all clusters using a binary fraction of 0.

 Eight clusters from the SMC are missing (got lost somewhere in the FTP moving).
 These clusters will not be present in the runs: 14, 15, 16.

#### `14th_run`

  Re-process all clusters using fixed distance moduli (18.49/18.96, S/LMC) and
  increasing the maximum extinction by 0.05. Maximum mass increased to 30000.
  * No bootstrap process is applied.

#### `15th_run`

  Re-process all clusters using:

  * No bootstrap.
  * Range in extinction: **MCEV max + 0.1** for all clusters.
  * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
    LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02]
  * Maximum mass: 30000.

#### `16th_run`

  Equal to 15th run but using a fixed mass of 1500 Mo and `Tolstoy` likelihood
  instead of `Dolphin`.
  **Correction**: I used  *whitout noticing* a mass interval of:
  `TM 10 1500` in the `params_input.dat` file instead of fixing it to a value
  of `1500`.
  This caused the mass values in the range to be defined by
  `np.arange(10, 1500)` as `[  10,   11,   12, ..., 1497, 1498, 1499]`, ie:
  a step of 1 solar mass.

#### `17th_run`

 Process 8 clusters with large age differences: BSDL631, H88-131, H88-316,
 KMHK975, KMHK979, SL218, SL579, L35.

 * Range in extinction: **MCEV max** for all clusters.
 * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
   LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02]
 * Fixed mass: 1500.
 * `Tolstoy`.

#### `18th_run`

 *Important*: for all these clusters' data files the x,y columns are inverted.

 Process the 29 SMC clusters from Maia et al. (2014). Use the same parameters
 as in the 3rd run:

 * Semi mode with center and radius fixed for several clusters.
 * Number of field regions set individually for some clusters.
 * Restricted range in extinction: **MCEV max for all clusters**.
 * Restricted distance modulus:  SMC, [18.86, 19.061, 0.02] ;
   LMC, [18.4, 18.601, 0.02].
 * Total mass: 10000
